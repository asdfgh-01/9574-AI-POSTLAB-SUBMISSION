1. The difference between the A* and AO* algorithms lies in their approach to handling heuristic values during the search process:
   - A* (A-star) algorithm: A* combines elements of uniform-cost search and greedy best-first search. It uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal efficiently while considering the cost of reaching each node. A* guarantees finding the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost) and consistent (satisfies the triangle inequality).
   - AO* (AO-star) algorithm: AO* extends the A* algorithm by allowing overestimation of heuristic values during the search. It adjusts the algorithm to tolerate and correct overestimations, potentially improving efficiency by expanding fewer nodes. AO* aims to find the optimal solution even when the heuristic is not admissible, but it may require more computational resources compared to A*.

2. The AO* algorithm only works effectively when heuristic values are underestimated because it relies on correcting overestimations during the search process. If heuristic values are overestimated, AO* may fail to converge to the optimal solution or may require significant computational resources to correct the overestimations. By starting with underestimations, AO* has room to adjust heuristic values upward during the search while still ensuring convergence to the optimal solution. Overestimations can lead to incorrect path choices and potentially cause the algorithm to explore unnecessary nodes, reducing its efficiency and effectiveness in finding the optimal solution.
